Initial Proposal
Arctic research produces a plethora of data from many different institutes, but joining it up can often be a difficult process meaning interactions and patterns in the data can get lost. We’ll document a workflow of connecting oceanic, meteorological and biological data to produce an interactive map helping to show data trends over time, focusing on Svalbard and its environment. The resulting output will help everyone better understand the data that’s being collected, as well as guiding people on how to easily connect data up for themselves.

Scientific Context: Arctic Food Chain
Mean temperature increase in the Arctic as a result of climate change is having cascading effects on local food chains. The consequences of this are perhaps most clearly seen in changing polar bear feeding patterns, which often result in intrusions into local urban areas and close encounters with people. We gathered data from various sources to understand and visualise how changing meteorological patterns affect phytoplankton at the base of the Arctic food chain, resulting in detrimental effects on polar bears. We opted for a bottom-up approach to understand and highlight the pervasive effects that climate change has on Arctic food chains as a whole.

Phytoplankton blooms occur on a seasonal cycle. When ice melts in the Northern spring, cold water sinks to the bottom, forcing nutrient rich water to the surface, thus providing ideal conditions for phytoplankton blooms. As sea ice melt onset occurs earlier in the year, krill and other aquatic invertebrates that feed on phytoplankton blooms have increasingly limited access to their food source. Krill populations are further diminished in the absence of ice because juveniles lack the protection offered by ice sheets. Crustaceans and fish species such as Arctic cod, Saffron cod, also spawn under sea ice, so reducing sea fields reduces their population, thus reducing the availability of prey to Ringed and Bearded seals. Polar bears need to build up fat to be able to rear and feed their young, in addition to surviving hibernation over winter. In the absence of abundant seals and sea ice as a platform to hunt them, they need to further venture into human settlements looking for food sources. Unsurprisingly, polar bear populations are decreasing as a result.

The aim was to give scientists access to data to help them to understand the extent to which the tropic levels are influenced by temperature or ice extent changes.
